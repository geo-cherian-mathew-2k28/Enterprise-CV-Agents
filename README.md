🛡️ SentinelFlow: Privacy Shield

  Status: Active | Domain: Cybersecurity / DLP

  SentinelFlow is an intelligent "End-User Privacy Agent" designed to combat visual hacking and shoulder surfing in remote/hybrid work environments. Unlike traditional passive security, SentinelFlow actively monitors the physical environment behind the user.

🚀 Key Capabilities

  0-Shot Authentication: Detects user presence instantly without calibration.

  Anti-Shoulder Surfing: Instantly detects unauthorized faces (2+ people) behind the user.

  Automated DLP (Data Loss Prevention): Triggers an immediate "Privacy Blur" effect on the screen when a threat is detected, obscuring sensitive data in real-time.

  Audit Logging: Tracks security breaches and timestamps for compliance reporting.

🧘 ErgoGuard: Health Engine

  Status: Active | Domain: Occupational Health / Bio-Mechanics

  ErgoGuard is a real-time biomechanical analysis engine that prevents Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) and "Tech Neck." It transforms a standard webcam into a medical-grade posture corrector using geometric vector analysis.

🚀 Key Capabilities

  Vector Analysis: Calculates complex geometric angles between the Ear, Shoulder, and Hip to determine spinal alignment.

  Heuristic Feedback: Differentiates between momentary movement and sustained poor posture to reduce false positives.

  Real-Time HUD: A "Iron Man" style overlay providing live feedback on spinal integrity without disrupting workflow.

  No Hardware Required: Replaces expensive wearable sensors with pure Computer Vision software.

🛠️ Installation & Usage

  These projects require Python 3.x and a standard webcam.

1. Clone the Repository

        git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Enterprise-CV-Agents.git](https://github.com/yourusername/Enterprise-CV-Agents.git)
        cd Enterprise-CV-Agents


2. Install Dependencies

   We use a lightweight stack focused on high-performance inference.

        pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy


3. Run the Agents

To launch the Privacy Shield:

python SentinelFlow.py


To launch the Ergonomics Engine:

python ErgoGuard.py
